# Active Directory

## Objective
Welcome to the Active Directory Project. In this project you will see how 
organizations manage their resources such as users, computers and groups.
This project will showcase how to install an active directory, create a 
splunk instance where it will be ingesting events from a windows server.
The windoows server will hold the active directory. You will also see
events generated ingested from the target windows machine. The project will then 
move on to perform a brute force attack using Kali Linux as our attacking
machine to see what telemetry it generates. This project will also use
atomic redteam aswell.

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
